      <h1>LUNCH IDEAS</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Lunch is by far my favorite meal of the day! In relation to exercise, lunch is when I eat to either fuel my body or recover. As a college student, I have learned to create quick, nutritious, versatile meals that I do not get sick of. I love changing up basic meals by switching the protein, starch, or seasonings. While I am constantly trying out new recipes, lunch usually stays pretty consistent. Lunch is my favorite meal, and usually very nutrient-dense and protein-packed!</p>

        <a name="sushi"></a>
        <h2>Sushi</h2>
        <p>One of my favorite lunch meals – because it is so quick and easy to switch up – is homemade sushi! In order to create this, you simply need seaweed wraps, rice, and vegetables! I learned how to make this sushi by watching various online videos, however the technique is very simple and just requires tight wrapping and a steady hand. My favorite combinations are avocado/cucumber, avocado/asparagus, or grilled tofu with any vegetables!</p>

          <h2>Tofu Scramble</h2>
          <p>One of my new favorite go-to meals is a tofu scramble paired with veggies and hummus! This is an easy way to get in a lot of protein, as well as tons of veggies! Although I often eat this for lunch, this meal can be enjoyed at any time of day!</p>

            <h2>Sandwich</h2>
            <p>A quick, go-to, versatile meal I often eat for lunch is a sandwich! I love Ezekiel bread, and am constantly trying out new sandwich combinations. Pictured here is one of my favorite sandwich combinations: hummus, avocado, spinach, cucumbers and hot sauce! I dip this sandwich in barbecue sauce, and love to eat with a side of fruit or veggies. This meal is filling, fueling, and is also great to take on the go and eat while studying!</p>

            <h2>Lentils and Veggies</h2>
            <p>Another meal that is super easy to prepare ahead of time is lentils!! I love lentils, and they are such a great source of vegan protein! Here I ate sauteed broccoli and cauliflower, and ate it with a big scoop of lentils, marinara sauce, and sriracha. Super easy, filling, and colorful !

          <h2>Potato Fries</h2>
          <p>My most common meal (by far) is potatoes! I usually roast potatoes at the beginning of the week, and then eat them with most of my meals! Pictured here is potato french fries, rice, spinach, and a side of veggies!</p>
