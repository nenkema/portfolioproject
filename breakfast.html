      <h1>BREAKFAST IDEAS</h1>
      </div>
      <p>Breakfast foods are my favorite to make! However, as a college student with an early babysitting job and then class immediately after, I rarely find the time to make a thorough breakfast. On the weekends or school breaks, I love to create exciting breakfasts! Most of the recipes you will see below are from when I actually have time to make a fun breakfast. My go-tos are smoothie bowls, pancakes, and oatmeal. Additionally, I love cooking for friends and family, and often make breakfast for two!</p>

        <h2>Oatmeal Parfait</h2>
        <p>This “oatmeal parfait” is a perfect example of a quick breakfast I often eat. Although quick and simple, this breakfast is still delicious and great fuel for a long day. Here, I have oatmeal on the bottom (mixed in with peanut butter, maple syrup, and chia seeds), topped with cereal (because I ran out of oatmeal), and strawberries!</p>

          <h2>Chia Pudding</h2>
          <p>Chia pudding is another example of a quick, easy breakfast I eat often at school. Chia pudding is simple to prepare at the beginning of the week, and add toppings when it comes to actually eating it. Here, I had chia pudding (non-dairy milk, chia seed, and sweetener refrigerated overnight), topped with bananas, coconut flakes, dates, and strawberries! I love chia pudding because it is so easy to customize, and is a great source of vegan protein and vitamins.</p>

            <h2>Acaí Bowl</h2>
            <p>Acaí is an awesome superfood – packed with antioxidants and nutrients. I love making acaí bowls for breakfast because they are so colorful, filling, and feels like I am eating ice cream for breakfast. Here I blended a frozen acaí packet (from costco) with a banana and almond milk. I also LOADED this bowl up with fruit and granola!</p>

            <h2>Pancakes</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite things to do on weekend mornings is whip up a giant batch of vegan cinnamon pancakes for my family and friends. This recipe is so tasty, and pleases both vegans and omnivores! My go-to pancake ingredients are oats, non-dairy milk, banana, coconut sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla extract. Pancakes are also a great way to sneak in extra vitamins by adding in chia seeds, flax seeds, or protein powder.</p>

            <h2>Green Smoothie</h2>
            <p>A quick, light, and super healthy breakfast I eat often is a nutrient-dense green smoothie. Green smoothies are a great way to secretly incorporate tons of veggies and vitamins without even tasting them! My go to recipe is: kale (frozen or fresh), coconut water, frozen banana, pineapple, and chia seeds! This is a great meal for on the go!</p>
