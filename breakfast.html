    <h1>Breakfast Ideas</h1>
    <p>Breakfast foods are my favorite to make! However, as a college student with an early babysitting job and then class immediately after, I rarely find the time to make a thorough breakfast. On the weekends or school breaks, I love to create exciting breakfasts! Most of the recipes you will see below are from when I actually have time to make a fun breakfast. My go-tos are smoothie bowls, pancakes, and oatmeal. Additionally, I love cooking for friends and family, and often make breakfast for two!</p>

      <h2>Oatmeal Parfait</h2>
      <p>This “oatmeal parfait” is a perfect example of a quick breakfast I often eat. Although quick and simple, this breakfast is still delicious and great fuel for a long day. Here, I have oatmeal on the bottom (mixed in with peanut butter, maple syrup, and chia seeds), topped with cereal (because I ran out of oatmeal), and strawberries!</p>
